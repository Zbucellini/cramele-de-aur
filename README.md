# Cramele de Aur

## Overview

The website is built using modern web technologies such as **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**.

The design emphasizes both aesthetics and functionality, offering visitors an engaging and intuitive browsing experience.

Key aspects include:

- **Modern Styling:**  
  Advanced CSS3 techniques for responsive layouts, smooth transitions, and dynamic visual effects.
  
- **Interactive Behavior:**  
  JavaScript is employed to create engaging, interactive components like dynamic menus and real-time form validations.

## Website Architecture

The website's structure is organized into three distinct levels:

- **Level 1:**  
  The main landing page serves as the primary gateway to the website.

- **Level 2 (Primary Pages):**  
  The core sections of the site include:
  - About
  - Wines
  - Our Team
  - Experiences
  - Contact

- **Level 3 (Sub-Pages):**  
  Certain primary pages expand into more detailed sub-pages:
  - The **Wines** section features dedicated pages for various wine varieties.
  - The **Experiences** section offers sub-pages that detail the diverse activities and experiences available.



This hierarchical organization not only enhances user navigation but also supports a clear content strategy that is easy to maintain and scale.
