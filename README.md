Cramele de Aur

"Cramele de Aur" is a website created as a second-year college project for a wine producer and winery. The project focuses on developing the frontend of the site with a strictly hierarchical three-level structure, ensuring all content is organized clearly and coherently.


The website is built using modern technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, enabling the creation of an attractive and functional interface. In addition to adhering to a solid hierarchical architecture, the project incorporates responsive design, ensuring seamless adaptability across all devices‚Äîfrom desktops to mobile phones‚Äîfor an optimal user experience.


Furthermore, the website features various dynamic functionalities that enhance interactivity and provide smooth, intuitive navigation. The contact page includes a fully functional form, allowing users to send messages directly, which will generate an email notification to the website's administrator. All content is implemented in Romanian to ensure clear and accessible communication for the target audience.
